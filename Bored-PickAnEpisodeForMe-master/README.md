# Bored-PickAnEpisodeForMe
Wrote a program in Python to pick and play an episode for me .

Antivirus may raise an alarm when running the exe file(present in the enclosed zip).
Only way to get it running is by disabling AV  or by adding the file as exception .

Users with Python installed in their systems can run the code directly (>>Python PickAnEpisodeForMe.py)
